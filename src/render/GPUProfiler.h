/**
 * @file GPUProfiler.h
 * @brief Section-based GPU timestamp profiler owned by the RenderGraph.
 *
 * The profiler brackets each frame and each pass with GPU timestamp queries:
 *   BeginFrame → (BeginPass/EndPass)* → EndFrame → Resolve
 *
 * The RenderGraph drives BeginPass/EndPass around every pass->Record(), so
 * passes stay completely unaware of GPU profiling. DeferredRenderer drives
 * BeginFrame/EndFrame and calls Resolve() once the frame slot's fence has
 * signaled.
 *
 * Query layout per frame slot (queriesPerFrame = 2 + 2 * kMaxPasses):
 *   slotBase + 0            frame begin (eTopOfPipe)
 *   slotBase + 1            frame end   (eBottomOfPipe)
 *   slotBase + 2 + 2*i + 0  pass i begin
 *   slotBase + 2 + 2*i + 1  pass i end
 *
 * The profiler owns its own slot cursor (advanced in EndFrame), which stays in
 * lockstep with the renderer's frame-in-flight index because BeginFrame/
 * EndFrame are called exactly once per successfully recorded frame. Resolve()
 * reads the slot about to be reused this frame (its fence has already
 * signaled), giving results a 1-2 frame lag by design. A per-slot "written"
 * guard skips never-recorded slots so the first reads never touch an
 * uninitialized query (VUID-vkGetQueryPoolResults-None-09401).
 *
 * Opt-in: the pool is only created when the device reports
 * `timestampComputeAndGraphics` and the graphics queue family supports
 * timestamps. When unavailable every method is a safe no-op and Resolve()
 * returns false.
