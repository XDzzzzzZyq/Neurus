/**
 * @file DescriptorBinder.h
 * @brief Writes a pass's declared image attachments into its descriptor set.
 *
 * DescriptorBinder turns a pass's `PassIO` declaration (see Pass.h) into
 * concrete descriptor writes, replacing hand-written per-pass descriptor
 * plumbing. Each `AttachmentBinding` carries the shader binding slot, the
 * descriptor type (combined image sampler vs storage image), and the image
 * layout the shader expects.
 *
 * Wave 2 scope: images only. UBO / SSBO / sampler-only bindings remain
 * hand-written on the pass. A single shared sampler is supplied by the
 * caller and used for every combined-image-sampler binding; storage-image
 * bindings ignore it.
 *
 * @note This is a pure translation helper — it performs no barriers and no
 *       layout transitions. The caller (pass or RenderGraph) is responsible
 *       for transitioning attachments to `imageLayout` before dispatch.
