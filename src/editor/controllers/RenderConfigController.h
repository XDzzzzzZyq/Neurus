/**
 * @file RenderConfigController.h
 * @brief Render-config controller — applies + records whole-config edits.
 *
 * RenderConfigController is the single mutation path for RenderConfig. It
 * subscribes to RenderConfigChangedEvent (emitted by the UI panel and replayed
 * by SetRenderConfigOp) and writes the new config into the Editor-owned
 * RenderConfig, reached through the ControllerContext's config provider — so
 * the controller holds no reference to the config (or any context member).
 *
 * Undo bounding mirrors the camera drag gesture: a slider drag brackets its
 * stream of value changes with ConfigEditBegin / ConfigEditEnd, so the whole
 * drag collapses to a single SetRenderConfigOp recorded on release. Discrete
 * edits (checkbox, combo box) arrive without a gesture and are recorded
 * immediately, one op each.
 *
 * @note RenderConfig is a scene-level (not pooled) Editor singleton, so it is
 *       reached through the context's config provider rather than the pool.
