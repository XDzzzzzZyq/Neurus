/**
 * @file EditorContext.h
 * @brief Shared read-only snapshot of Editor-owned state (scene + config).
 *
 * EditorContext is the common editor state that both the Renderer and the UI
 * need each frame. It is produced once by Editor::GetContext() and embedded by
 * value into both RenderContext (render layer) and UIContext (UI layer), so the
 * Editor exposes a single source of truth instead of building each context
 * separately.
 *
 * Architecture:
 * - Lives in the Vulkan-free scene layer so both render/ and ui/ may include it.
 * - `scene` is the Editor-owned Scene upcast to its UID base; consumers cast it
 *   back to `const Scene*`.
 * - `config` stays an opaque `const void*` (a RenderConfig*) so this header does
 *   not pull the renderer's RenderConfig into the UI layer.
