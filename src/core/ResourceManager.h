/**
 * @file ResourceManager.h
 * @brief Central factory + registry for every persistent UID object.
 *
 * ResourceManager is the single factory and registry for UID-derived objects
 * (scene objects via ObjectID, data resources like MeshData/ImageData/Shader).
 * It is app-scoped (owned by the Editor), type-erased (holds shared_ptr<UID>),
 * and owns the polymorphic serialization of the whole pool.
 *
 * Design (see docs/superpowers/plans/2026-08-07-resource-manager-design.md):
 * - UID is the ONLY resource base - every pooled object derives from it and
 *   serializes itself (identity + own fields), bound by UID + cereal
 *   polymorphism. No reload hook interface: each object's serialize(load)
 *   restores its own state.
 * - Load<T>(args...) constructs + registers in one step.
 * - Scene neither owns nor references the pool; it holds plain typed pools and
 *   resolves references against the pool via Scene::ResolveReferences.
 * - No UID object knows the ResourceManager and no UID object constructs
 *   another UID object internally - construction happens through Load<T>.
 * - The pool serializes the real objects (polymorphically); Scene serializes
 *   only ID references. Pool is loaded before the Scene.
 *
 * @note Thread-safety: Not thread-safe. Main thread only.
